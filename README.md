## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/synthara.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the React frontend and the backend server.

## Available Commands

To run the project, use the scripts defined in the `package.json` file. These scripts handle development, production, and utility operations.

---

### Development

Start the development environment (both React frontend and backend server):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start only the React frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

Start only the development server with auto-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev-server
```

---

### Production

Build the application and start the production server:

```bash
npm run prod
```

Build the application without starting the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start only the production server:

```bash
npm run start-prod
```

---

### Utility

Update the changelog file:

```bash
npm run update-changelog
```

Kill the development or production server manually:

```bash
npm run kill-server
```

---

## Fixing Changelog Issues

If the changelog does not display properly, follow these steps:

1. Run the changelog update script:

   ```bash
   npm run update-changelog
   ```

2. Restart the development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This triggers the `copy-changelog.js` script, which is configured to handle YAML front matter correctly. It then starts both the frontend and backend servers.

If you are only testing the changelog component:

```bash
npm start
```
